## Getting Started

This application is written in Visual Basic, using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition. I will be upgrading to a newer version of VS some time, but at the moment there is no rush to do this.

**Beware:** Right now, you will probably not be able to just load the *CoinTracer.sln* in your VS and get the whole thing up and running. There is a test projekt still missing in this repository. I will do some refactoring and will upload it later.

**But:** In the meantime you can simply load the VB projekt file *\CoinTracer\CoinTracer.vbproj* and play around with the code.


### Prerequisites

You basically just need Visual Studio 2015 Community edition. All nuget packages this project makes use of should be retrieved automatically.


### Installing

You can download the latest versions here: https://www.cointracer.de/?q=download


## What about testing?

As mentioned above, the test project will soon be added to this repository.
